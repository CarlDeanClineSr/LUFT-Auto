# Code of Conduct

We are building toward unification with scientific rigor and mutual respect.

Expectations
- Be respectful and welcoming. No harassment, personal attacks, or discrimination.
- Assume good intent; critique ideas, not people.
- Keep discussions focused on the work and the mission.

Reporting
- For conduct concerns, email: carldcline@gmail.com (confidential to maintainers).
- For security issues, follow SECURITY.md.

Enforcement
- Maintainers may take action (warnings, limited participation, or removal) to keep the community healthy.
