# Contributing to LUFT-Auto

Thanks for your interest in contributing to LUFT-Auto!

## How we work
- Fork or branch from `main`.
- Small, focused pull requests are best.
- Reference issues when possible (e.g., "Fixes #123").

## Development workflow
1. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feat/<short-name>`
2. Make changes, add tests/docs where relevant.
3. Run the smoke test (docs/SMOKE_TEST.md) to confirm nothing obvious breaks.
4. Open a PR and fill out the template.

## Commit messages
- Use clear, descriptive messages (e.g., `feat: add smoke test config`, `fix: guard against missing column`).

## Code review
- CODEOWNERS will automatically request reviews from default owners.
- Be responsive to review comments; keep the discussion friendly and focused.

## Credits
- If your contribution deserves explicit acknowledgment, add yourself or your organization to CREDITS.md (or ask a maintainer to do so).
