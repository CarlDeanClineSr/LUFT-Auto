# Start Here: LUFT & Reality-based-Space

Welcome!  
This project investigates the unification and underlying structure of space, time, energy, and matterâ€”using lattice theory, scale invariance, and real experimental data.

**What to do first:**  
- Read [README.md](./README.md) for the big picture and main claims.
- Explore [ALL_EXTRACTED_MATH.md](./ALL_EXTRACTED_MATH.md) for the raw math/theory.
- See `/docs/` for protocols, theory, and experiment guides.
- For code, start in `/src/` or `/scripts/`.

**Key Questions:**  
- What is the lattice structure of reality?
- Is there a universal resonance (7468.779 Hz) in nature?
- Can theory and experiment converge to reveal the fabric of the cosmos?
