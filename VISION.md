# LUFT-Auto Vision

Mission
- Advance unification across energy, matter, space, and time by building open, testable tools and analyses.

Principles
- Science-first: clarity, reproducibility, and measurable progress.
- Open by default: share configs, samples, and docs that make results repeatable.
- Human-centered: this is for Earth—every man, woman, and child—so the work must be understandable and accessible.
- Iterative rigor: small, verifiable steps, with explicit assumptions and controls.

Near-term Goals
- Establish stable, versioned configs and a repeatable smoke test.
- Document data contracts (columns, units, ranges).
- Build stubs for advanced analysis (e.g., resolution equalization) behind feature flags.
