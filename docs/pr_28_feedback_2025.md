Captain Carl,

Here's the concise status and what I recommend next. Purpose: keep CI signals clear so our unification work (structure/dynamics of space-time-energy) stays reproducible and fast.

Current PRs (review/merge order)
1) LUFT-Auto #28 — Add workflow badges beside repo names in the dashboard
   - Effect: instant visual status per repo; badge links to the workflow page for main.
   - Action: Review the rendering and link targets → Merge if clean.

2) Unified-Field-Theory-Solutions-2025 #20 — Add primary workflow badge to README
   - Effect: puts a live status badge at top of the README.
   - Action: Confirm it's under the first H1 and points to the main branch → Merge.

3) LUFT-Auto #27 — Clickable CI status + README badge (already addressed by later work)
   - If not merged yet, it's the foundation for #28; otherwise, proceed with #28.

Why it matters for unification
- The dashboard is our heartbeat. Green = move theory forward; red/stale = unblock quickly.
- This keeps cross-repo simulations consistent with physics changes (space-time-energy dynamics).

What's working
- CI Status column links directly to the latest run on main.
- Stale and Last Success provide quick health context.
- Badges (PR #28, #20) make status obvious at a glance.

Small refinements to consider (post-merge)
- Tooltip/alt text: "Workflow: <name> — main".
- Optional columns: Last Run Time; Security alerts count; Last release age.
- Daily digest: post failures/stale repos to Slack or a tracking issue.

Teaching handoff (1–2 minutes)
- Say: "Run the dashboard, click red Xs, file issues, add missing badges, re-run."
- Show one example click-through from CI Status → failing job → new issue link.
- Confirm the badge next to a repo name opens the workflow page filtered to main.

Call to action
- Merge #28 (dashboard badges) and #20 (README badge).
- I'll queue a follow-on to add badges to Reality-based-Space-and-its-functionality once this lands.
