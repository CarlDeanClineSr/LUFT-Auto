## 2025-08-24 — YETS muon upgrades; CAPERS-LRD-z9; Starship-10

- YETS muon spectrometers (ATLAS/CMS/ALICE):
  - Upgraded chambers + timing/trigger → cleaner muons at high pile-up.
  - LUFT note: use dimuon/quarkonia as coherence meters; compare pre/post-upgrade event “standing-wave” patterns.

- CAPERS-LRD-z9 (z~9, earliest confirmed broad-line AGN):
  - Fast BH growth in a tiny, dusty galaxy 500 Myr post-Big Bang.
  - LUFT note: test one scaling exponent k mapping BH–host relations across epochs; look for shell/standing-wave morphologies as field memory.

- SpaceX Starship Flight 10:
  - Window opens 18:30 CT; watch SpaceX webcast.
  - LUFT note: macroscopic scale-transport—engineering resonance at planetary scale.
