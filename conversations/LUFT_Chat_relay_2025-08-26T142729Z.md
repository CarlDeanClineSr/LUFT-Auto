# LUFT — Relay Capsule after chat loss
Timestamp (UTC): 2025‑08‑26 14:27:29  
Repo: LUFT‑Auto  
Author: Dr. Carl Dean Cline Sr (“Captain/Professor Cline”) with Copilot

Why this exists
- A Copilot chat titled “Detail‑oriented overview of LUFT program” disappeared (“Conversation not found”). This capsule preserves the thread so it cannot be lost again. Save one like this at least every 2 hours.

What we’re protecting (math spine)
- Interaction action → capacity → CHSH:
  - K(T) = (1/ħ) ∫₀ᵀ ||H_int(t)|| dt
  - C_cap(T) = sin(K(T)); S_max(T) = 2 √(1 + C_cap(T)²)
  - With decoherence η: S_max,η = 2 √(1 + η² sin² K)
- Quantum speed limits: τ ≥ πħ/(2ΔE), τ ≥ ħ/(2Ē_above_ground)
- Gravitational phase toy: K_grav ≈ (1/ħ) ∫ |ΔV| dt; small‑offset ΔV ≈ 2 G m² δ / r²
- Scale invariance: O_macro = λ^k O_micro (k to be fit; do not assume)
- Field memory (effective): ∂Ψ/∂t = F_drive − γΨ + 𝒟[Ψ]; p_eff = ∫ (F_self + ∇Ψ_bg) dt
- Resonance testing spine: f0 = 7468.779 Hz; harmonics/rationals; gates = PSD z+FDR, PLV≥0.6 with permutation p≤0.05, drift and decoys

Today’s alignment
- Bell/EPR/CHSH docs in repo are correct and aligned with the capacity model above.
- ATLAS Run‑3 news (H→μμ evidence; H→Zγ sensitivity) is logged and used as a stats/controls benchmark (not a LUFT resonance claim).

What to do next (no risk)
- Keep archiving chats here in conversations/ with timestamps.
- Point newcomers to START_HERE.md (added in this commit) and results/SUMMARY_TABLE.md.
- Defer all workflows/AI steps until secrets are guarded and Python is pinned.

Notes on the lost chat
- Deleting OPENAI_API_KEY breaks AI steps in GitHub Actions but does not delete Copilot chats. The loss is a session issue; the fix is this archive routine.

Next archive window
- Target: +2 hours from this timestamp. Create conversations/LUFT_Chat_Relay_YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ.md again.
